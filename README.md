# Debrief - Material from completely non-required reading & exploration alongside my graduate program

This basically is a list of things that blew my mind/provided intuition to what I was into over the period of grad school. None of them were of any kind of required reading for school. I sort of wish some of them were.
Some are full-texts, some are Amazon links (Maybe you can borrow it off a library. I did). 

There are also published articles, arxiv papers links and youtube videos in the list. 
I have classified them by the general phase that I was in while discovering each of these resources. Often the phases highly correlate to the classes I was taking in school.
